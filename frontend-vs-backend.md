# Frontend vs Backend – Explained Simply

In web development, **frontend** and **backend** are two key areas — and they do very different things.

The **frontend** is what users see and interact with. It includes the website layout, buttons, menus, images, and overall design. Technologies used here include **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap**, etc.

The **backend**, on the other hand, is what powers the frontend behind the scenes. It handles things like databases, user authentication, server logic, and APIs. It uses languages like **Python, Java, Node.js**, and databases like **MySQL or MongoDB**.

Think of a restaurant:  
- Frontend = dining area and menu (what you see)  
- Backend = kitchen and management system (what happens in the background)

Both are essential for a complete, functional web app.
