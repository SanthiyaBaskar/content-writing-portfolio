# 📝 Content Writing Portfolio by Santhiya Baskar

Welcome to my content writing showcase! Although I come from a technical background in Electronics & Communication Engineering, I have a deep passion for communication, creativity, and simplifying complex concepts through writing.

This repository includes:
- Blog articles
- Product descriptions
- Email samples
- Technical content
- Social media samples

All content is original, written by me, and reflects my interest in becoming a versatile content writer — capable of bridging the gap between tech and creativity.
